A program that trains models to sort text into different genres.

First, you need to install the glove folder in order for the models to successfully work.  Instructions to do that can be found online.
Store the GloVE embedding file in a folder called glove.

You can run three of the following models:
1) For the simple feedforward model with 5 genres -- python feedforward.py
2) For the feedforward model with stopwords removed -- python clean_feedforward.py
3) For the LSTM -- python lstm.py
